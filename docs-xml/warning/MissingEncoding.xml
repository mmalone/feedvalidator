<p>No character encoding was specified</p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>The XML document doesn't declare a character encoding. According to
the standard it will be treated as UTF-8, but this may not be
correct.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>If the document uses something other than UTF-8, you must add
an explicit declaration as the very first line of the document:</p>
<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="<i>encoding-name</i>"?>
</pre>
<p>where <i>encoding-name</i> is windows-1252, iso-8859-1, or whichever
encoding the document is written with. If this is a perfectly valid
UTF-8 document, adding the declaration avoids ambiguity.</p>
<p>If you are not sure what encoding your tooling uses, following the
instructions in the
