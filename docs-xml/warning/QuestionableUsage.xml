<p>Undocumented use of <code>element</code></p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>You are using an extension element in a context for which basic constraints
(e.g. cardinality, uniqueness) and semantics for this element have not been
defined.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>Check to see if this element is misplaced.  If you misplace
an element, this information may not be recognized by feed
consumers.</p>
<p>If the element placement is intentional, be aware that the feed validator
is unable to verify the correct usage of this element in this context.
Also be aware that this usage is not likely to be widely supported.</p>
<p>If you know of a extension element usage that you feel that the feed
validator should support,
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/feedvalidator-users">please let us know</a>.</p>
