<p>An &lt;outline&gt; element whose type is "rss" may have a version attribute, whose value must be RSS, RSS1, RSS2, or scriptingNews.</p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>From the OMPL guidelines: version varies depending on the version of RSS that's being supplied. It was invented at a time when we thought there might be some processors that only handled certain versions, but that hasn't turned out to be a major issue. The values it can have are: RSS1 for RSS 1.0; RSS for 0.91, 0.92 or 2.0; scriptingNews for scriptingNews format.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>Either omit the version attribute entirely, or change it to be one of
values listed above.</p>
