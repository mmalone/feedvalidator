<p>Two entries with the same value for <code>atom:updated</code></p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>Date values SHOULD be as accurate as possible.  For example, it would
be generally inappropriate for a publishing system to apply the same
timestamp to several entries which were published during the course
of a single day.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>Ensure that these atom:updated entries are as accurate as possible.
This check is not something that can be automated.</p>
<p>If the two atom:entry elements in question were updated at the same
time, then no action is necessary.</p>
