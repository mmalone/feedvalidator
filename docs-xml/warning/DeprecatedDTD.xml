<p>The use of this DTD has been deprecated by Netscape</p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>Netscape is <a href="http://blog.netscape.com/2007/01/16/to-dtd-or-not-to-dtd/">planning on removing</a> this DTD as of July 1, 2007.
This will cause a number of feed readers to fail to be able to
process your feed.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>One solution is to remove the reference to the DTD entirely.  If you
elect to do this simply be sure that none of the named entity references
defined in the DTD are used in your feed.  Once you remove the DOCTYPE,
you can use the Feed Validator to check for such references.</p>
<p>An alternate solution is to take this opportunity to upgrade to a
newer feed format, such as
<a href="http://web.resource.org/rss/1.0/">RSS 1.0</a>,
<a href="http://www.rssboard.org/rss-specification">RSS 2.0</a>, or
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287">Atom 1.0</a>.</p>
