<p>Misplaced XHTML content</p>

<div id='explanation'>
<p>While both Atom and RSS 2.0 allow extension elements in any namespace,
specific elements are defined for textual content and it is in those elements
that feed consumers tend to look first for such content.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>If the placement of this element was intentional, this is not an error and
no change is required.  Otherwise, consider relocating this information
inside one of the elements which were designed for this purpose.</p>
