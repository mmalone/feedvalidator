<p>Missing Textual Content</p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>Experience teaches that feeds which contain textual content are in
general more useful than those which do not.  Some applications (one
example is full-text indexers) require a minimum amount of text or
(X)HTML to function reliably and predictably.  Feed producers should
be aware of these issues.  It is advisable that each atom:entry
element contain a non-empty atom:title element, a non-empty atom:
content element when that element is present, and a non-empty atom:
summary element when the entry contains no atom:content element.
However, the absence of atom:summary is not an error.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>No action is required as Atom processors MUST NOT fail to function
correctly as a consequence of such an absence.  However, consider
ensuring that there is at least a human readable summary
or content for each entry.</p>
