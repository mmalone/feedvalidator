<p>The prefix "<code>media</code>" generally is associated with the namespace "<code>http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/</code>"</p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>The namespace defined by the <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss">Media
RSS specification</a>
changes over time.
This appears to be a mistake, and the latest word from the specification&#8217;s
primary editor is that the version of the namespace which
includes a trailing slash is the correct one, despite whatever the
specification may say at any given point in time.</p>
<p>Here are a few links to prior discussions on the topic:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-media/message/1008">David Hall</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-public/message/1608">James Holderness</a></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>As this is an area of continuing confusion, consumers would be well
adivised to accept both forms of the namespace URI.</p>
<p>Producers of feeds should seek advice from the
<a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rss-media/">rss-media</a>
Yahoo! group as to which version is prefered at the moment.</p>
