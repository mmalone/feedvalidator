<p><code>foo</code> link relation found in entry</p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p><a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc5005.txt">RFC 5005</a> defines these
relations in the context of a "Head section" 
(e.g., the child elements of the atom:feed element in an Atom Feed Document)
but in this feed, archive and/or history links were found outside of the
head section.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>If these links are intended to express feed paging or archiving relationship,
move the link elements themselves outside of any entry.</p>
