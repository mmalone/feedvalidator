<p>Your feed appears to be encoded as &ldquo;<i>foo</i>&rdquo;, but your server is reporting &ldquo;<i>bar</i>&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>The XML appears to be using one encoding, but the HTTP headers from the
web server indicate a different charset. Internet standards require that the
web server's version takes preference, but many aggregators ignore this.
Note that, if you are serving content as '<code>text/*</code>', then
the default charset is US-ASCII, which is probably not what you want.
(See
<a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3023.html" title="RFC 3023 (rfc3023) - XML Media Types">RFC 3023</a> for technical details.)</p>
<p>RSS feeds should be served as <code>application/rss+xml</code>
(RSS 1.0 is an RDF format, so it may be served as
<code>application/rdf+xml</code> instead).
Atom feeds should use <code>application/atom+xml</code>.
Alternatively, for compatibility with widely-deployed web browsers, any of
these feeds can use one of the more
general XML types -  preferably <code>application/xml</code>.</p>
<p>Another possible cause is the use of single quotes to delimit the charset parameter in the http header, whereas the http definition of <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec2.html#sec2.2">Basic Rules</a> only permits the use of double quotes.  The result is somewhat confusing messages such as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
Your feed appears to be encoded as &ldquo;utf-8&rdquo;, but your server is reporting &ldquo;'utf-8'&rdquo;
</p>
</blockquote>

<div id='solution'>
<p>Either ensure that the charset parameter of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.17">HTTP Content-Type header</a> matches the
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#NT-EncodingDecl">encoding
declaration</a>, or ensure that the server makes no claims
about the encoding. Serving the feed as <code>application/xml</code> means
that the encoding will be taken from the file's declaration.</p>
<p>The W3C has 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/International/O-HTTP-charset">published
information</a> on how to set the HTTP charset parameter with various popular
web servers.</p>
<p>If you are unable to control your server's charset declaration,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#sec-references">Character
and Entity References</a> may be used to specify the full range of Unicode
characters in an feed served as US-ASCII.</p>
