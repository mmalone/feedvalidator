<div id='explanation'>
<p>The RSS specification actively discourages publishers from using the <span class="element">textInput</span> element, calling its purpose "something of a mystery" and stating that "most aggregators ignore it." Fewer than one percent of surveyed RSS feeds included the element. The only aggregators known to support it are BottomFeeder and Liferea.</p>

<p>For this reason, publishers <span class="rfc2119">should not</span> expect it to be supported in most aggregators.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>While this element is not actively harmful, it is generally best to
remove it unless you have a specific need for this function.</p>
