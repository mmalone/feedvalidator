<p>Implausible date: <code>foo</code></p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>While this date-time value is formatted correctly, it either appears to be
in the future, or far enough in the past to indicate that there might either be a software error, or an incorrectly set clock, involved.</p>
<p>Note that many clients sort by dates, either by default, or as an option.  For this reason, it is important that date values are as accurate as possible.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>Ensure that atom:updated and atom:published entries are as accurate.</p>
