<p>Relative <code>href</code> value on <code>self</code> link</p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>Link elements with a <code>rel="self"</code> attribute were originally designed to enable <a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/01/28/HowToSubscribe">One Click Subscription</a>s.  In particular, they were designed to enable
user agents to find the original feed long after it had been fetched and
the memory of the original URI used to fetch the feed has been forgotten,
as may occur when a browser hands a feed off to an aggregator.</p>
<p>Of course, this only works if the link can be resolved to an absolute
URI using only the information contained within the feed itself.</p>
<p>Here are a few links to prior discussions on the topic:</p>

</ul>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>Either make the value of the <code>href</code> attribute on this link an
absolute IRI, or add an <code>xml:base</code> attribute with a absolute IRI as its value on either this, or any enclosing, element.</p>
