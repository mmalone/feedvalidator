<p>Two entries with the same id</p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>If multiple atom:entry elements with the same atom:id value appear in
an Atom Feed Document, they represent the same entry.  Their atom:
updated timestamps SHOULD be different.  If an Atom Feed Document
contains multiple entries with the same atom:id, Atom Processors MAY
choose to display all of them or some subset of them.  One typical
behavior would be to display only the entry with the latest atom:
updated timestamp.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>Ensure that these atom:entry elements represent the same entry.
This check is not something that can be automated.</p>
<p>If the atom:entry elements in question represent
the same entry, be aware that the potential exists that different consumers
will display different subsets.  If this is not a concern, then no action is
necessary.  Otherwise, ensure that every distinct entry has a distinct
id, and ensure that every entry only appears in a given feed
only once.</p>
