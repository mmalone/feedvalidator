<p>Missing <code>atom:link</code> with <code>rel="self"</code></p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>atom:feed elements SHOULD contain one atom:link element with a rel
attribute value of "self".  This is the preferred URI for
retrieving Atom Feed Documents representing this Atom feed.</p>
<p>This value is important in a number of subscription scenarios where
often times the feed aggregator only has access to the content of
the feed and not the location from which the feed was fetched.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>Insert a fully qualified link to your feed using rel="self".</p>
</div>
