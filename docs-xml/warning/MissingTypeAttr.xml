<p>Missing content attribute: type</p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>If the "src" attribute is present, the "type" attribute SHOULD be
provided and MUST be a MIME media type, rather than "text",
"html", or "xhtml".  The value is advisory; that is to say, when the
corresponding URI (mapped from an IRI, if necessary), is
dereferenced, if the server providing that content also provides a
media type, the server-provided media type is authoritative.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>This may just be a typo.  Element names are case-sensitive; make sure you're using the right case.</p>
<p>Otherwise, insert the media type (example: <code>audio/mpeg</code>) of the
content as the value of the type attribute.</p>
