<p>Feed uses an obsolete namespace</p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>This feed is using an obsolete namespace used by an obsolete snapshot of Atom, which is not supported by this validator.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>Atom is an evolving specification.  When new snapshots come out, the validator is coded to support them, but it will not continue to validate previous snapshots.  If you are an early adopter trying out the new format, you should upgrade your feed to the latest version.</p>

<p>For more information about the latest Atom specification, please see the <a href="http://intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/">Atom Project Wiki</a>.</p>
