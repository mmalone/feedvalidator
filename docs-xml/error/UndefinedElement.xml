<div xmlns='http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml'>
<div id='message'>
<p>Undefined <code>parent</code> element: <code>child</code></p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>Your feed contains an element that this validator does not recognize in this context.</p>
<p>This may just be a typo.  Element names are case-sensitive; make sure you're using the right case.  For example, <code>pubDate</code> has a capital "D".</p>
<p>This may simply be a case of an element being placed in the wrong context.  For example: <code>itunes:category</code> can only be placed inside of the channel element, it does not belong inside an item.</p>
<p>If it is an undefined <code>root</code> element, then the document you are trying to validate is not a feed.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>Verify that you have placed this element where the specification requires.</p>
<p>If, instead, you were trying to include a new element that you have defined, you will need to put it in a <a href="../howto/declare_namespaces.html">namespace</a>.</p>
