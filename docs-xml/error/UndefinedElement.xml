<div id='message'>
<p>Undefined <code>foo</code> element: <code>bar</code></p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>Your feed contains an element that this validator does not recognize.</p>
<p>This may just be a typo.  Element names are case-sensitive; make sure you're using the right case.  For example, <code>pubDate</code> has a capital "D".</p>
<p>This may simply be a case of an element being placed in the wrong context.  For example: <code>itunes:category</code> can only be placed inside of the channel element, it does not belong inside an item.</p>
<p>If it is an undefined <code>root</code> element, then the document you are trying to validate is not a feed.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>

<p>If you were really trying to include a new element that you have defined, you will need to put it in a namespace.</p>
