<p>Unexpected <i>foo</i> attribute on <i>bar</i> element</p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>Your feed contains elements with attributes that are not defined in the
relevant specifications. Perhaps this is a typo (remember that XML is
case-sensitive; for example, <code>isPerma<strong>l</strong>ink</code> and
<code>isPerma<strong>L</strong>ink</code> have no relation to each other,
and only the latter has any meaning in the RSS 2.0 standard).</p>

<p>If you are trying to extend RSS, a new element in its own namespace is
likely to be more flexible, and less liable to cause interoperability
problems.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>Correct the attributes, or move the information into a namespaced
element.</p>
</div>
