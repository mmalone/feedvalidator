<p>Unable to validate, due to hardcoded resource limits (<i>limit</i>)</p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>To prevent denial-of-service attacks, the feed validator imposes certain
limits on the sizes of feeds it will process and the time it will spend
waiting for a web server to respond. One of these limits was exceeded during
validation.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>Validate a smaller representative sample of this feed, or download the
code and run it on your own system.</p>
