<p>All entries have the same id</p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>If multiple atom:entry elements with the same atom:id value appear in
an Atom Feed Document, they must represent the
<emph><strong>same</strong></emph> entry.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>Ensure that every distinct entry has a distinct
id, and ensure that every unique entry only appears in a given feed
exactly once.</p>
<p>If the atom:entry elements in question represent
the same entry, perhaps at different points in time, be aware that the
potential exists that different consumers
will display different subsets.  If this is not a concern, then no action is
necessary.</p>
