<p>Your feed couldn't be validated because there was a problem downloading
it from the web server. You should try to diagnose this using a web browser,
and make sure that the URL you supplied resolves to an accessible file.</p>
<p>One specific case that causes this is a server that claims the file
is compressed, but then serves an uncompressed file. You may need to contact
your host's administrators to resolve this problem.</p>

<div id='solution'>
<p>Make sure this URL can be downloaded with a browser, then try again.</p>
