<div id='explanation'>
<p>The value of the <code>since</code> attribute is intended to contain the lower bound of items contained within the feed.</p>
<p>The value of the <code>until</code> attribute is intended to contain the upper bound of items contained within the feed.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>Ensure that both of these values are represented in a manner that allows string collation by subscribers to yield the appropriate results.  For example, if the publisher uses a date-time value to represent an incorporation timestamp for since and until, the value MUST be normalized for string comparison (e.g. <code>2006-05-02T09:10:33Z</code> instead of <code>2 May 2006 09:10:33</code>)</p>
<p>If these values are reversed, simply swap them.  </p>
