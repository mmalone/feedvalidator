<p>Missing Summary</p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>atom:entry elements MUST contain an atom:summary element in either of the following cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>the atom:entry contains an atom:content that has a "src" attribute (and is thus empty).</li>
<li>the atom:entry contains content that is encoded in Base64; i.e., the "type" attribute of atom:content is a MIME media type, but is not an XML media type, does not begin with "text/", and does not end with "/xml" or "+xml".</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>Ensure that there is at least a human readable summary
or content for each entry.</p>
