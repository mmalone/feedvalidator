<p><code>foo</code> must be an RFC 3339 date-time</p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>The content of this element MUST conform to the "date-time" production as defined in <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3339.html">RFC 3339</a>.  In addition, an uppercase "T" character MUST be used to separate date and time, and an uppercase "Z" character MUST be present in the absence of a numeric time zone offset.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>Change the date-time format to comply with RFC 3339. Here are examples of valid RFC 3339 date-times:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><samp>2002-10-02T10:00:00-05:00</samp></p>
<p><samp>2002-10-02T15:00:00Z</samp></p>
<p><samp>2002-10-02T15:00:00.05Z</samp></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Common errors include using a space to separate the data and time, or omitting the time zone information.</p>
<p>Other potential errors include individual fields being out of range, for example a month of 13, or a day of 31 in a month that only contains 30 days.</p>
<p>Note that RFC 3339 is more strict than the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-datetime">W3C Date and Time Format</a>.  In particular, all portions of the date and time must be present, with the exception of the fractional portions of the second, which may be omitted.</p>
