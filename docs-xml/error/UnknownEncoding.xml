<p>Unknown XML character encoding: <i>foo</i></p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>There is a problem with the character encoding specified at the start
of this XML document. This may be a typo,
a form other than the preferred one (for example, <code>utf_8</code> rather
than <code>utf-8</code>), or just
an encoding that the validator cannot deal with.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>Correct the declaration, re-encode the document with an encoding
such as UTF-8 or UTF-16 or report the omission if this is a
<a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets" title="CHARACTER SETS">registered character set</a>.</p>
