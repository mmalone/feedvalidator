<div id='message'>
<p>Incorrect day of week: <code>foo</code></p>
</div>
<div id='explanation'>
<p>If included, day-of-week must be the day implied by the date
specification.</p>
<p>This may be indicative of a more significant software error in the
formatting of dates that needs to be corrected.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>If it turns out that computing the correct day of week is impractical
using the software you have available, then
<a href="http://www.sendmail.org/rfc/0822.html#5">RFC 822</a> permits omitting
both the day of the week and the subsequent comma from the value.</p>
