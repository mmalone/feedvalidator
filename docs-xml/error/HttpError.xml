<p>Your feed couldn't be validated because there was a problem downloading
it from the web server. You should try to diagnose this using a web browser,
and make sure that the URL you supplied resolves to an accessible file.</p>
<p>This usually means that the URL was wrong, or that permissions on
the server don't allow us to fetch that file. The error shows the
message that the server sent, which may help.</p>
</div>
<div id='solution'>
<p>Make sure this URL can be downloaded with a browser, then try again.</p>
