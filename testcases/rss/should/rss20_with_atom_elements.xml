<p>I know someone has to have suggested this in the past, but if so, I missed it... what might happen if RSS proponents simply adopted the most sought-after Atom ideas (the &lt;modified&gt; date and the more carefully thought out content model, for example) and inserted them into RSS 2.0 feeds with namespaces?</p>
<p>(Here's an <a href="http://support.journurl.com/users/admin/index.cfm?template=rss-atom">an RSS+Atom feed</a> using live data.)</p>
<p>Poof! Backwards compatibility (the feed is still a <a href="http://feedvalidator.org/check.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsupport.journurl.com%2Fusers%2Fadmin%2Findex.cfm%3Ftemplate%3Drss-atom">valid RSS 2.0 feed</a>) with the added goodies of Atom. Dave might find it funky, but in the grand scheme, isn't a funky bridge between formats a whole lot nicer than completely parallel development paths? Things might not be quite as simple for copy-n-paste developers, but at least we'll all be moving in the same direction, and users won't face confusion and breakage.</p>
<p>Isn't that the most important thing?</p>

<p><blockquote class="jquote"><a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1032_3-5157662.html?part=rss&amp;tag=feed&amp;subj=news">Google spurns RSS for rising blog format | CNET News.com</a><br />
"RSS has long been controlled by a single vendor or entity," said Mark Pilgrim, an early contributor to Atom. "Atom's an open standard, so people can point at the spec and say they're conforming to it, and it's not controlled by one of their competitors. And RSS is. It's no surprise that the vendors in control of RSS are upset about this. Open standards benefit everyone but them."</blockquote></p>
<p>Here's a clue folks. Atom is controlled by Google, IBM, Six Apart, and LiveJournal. Anything that interferes with those companies' plans or systems will not make it into the spec. Period. And three out of four of 'em are my competitors.</p>
<p>So why exactly is this supposed to make me feel better?</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong... I have nothing against those companies, and outside of Google's move to submarine the syndication world, I harbor no ill-will. If I had their power and influence, I would probably use it just as they are. At the end of the day, Atom is mostly about the good intentions of hyper-competitive people. I firmly believe that they mean well, even when they do destructive things.</p>
<p>But then, the same can be said for Dave Winer, RSS, and the Metaweblog API. No matter how much Pilgrim tries to couch his bitterness in the language of "openness", that's all there is to it.</p>
<p>Good people fuck up sometimes.</p>

<p>Firebird 0.8 is out, and it has a new name: <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/">Firefox</a>. Apparently, they wanted to avoid colliding with another, older open-source project called "Firebird".</p>
<p>Since 0.8 is more about bugfixes than features, there isn't much to say other than "go get it". However, it's worth noting that many themes and extensions that worked with older versions of Firebird will no longer work, or produce unexpected results.</p>
<p>For example, if you fire up the latest version and suddenly discover that you have no scrollbars, your theme is to blame. Switch back to the default, go install an updated version of your preferred look-and-feel, and everything will be back to normal.</p>

<p>I've added or updated a number of new tags that can be used in your templates. Unfortunately, I haven't written the documentation for them yet, so you'll have to settle for a brief description.</p>
<ul>
<li>&lt;weblog:include&gt; and &lt;weblog:includeitems&gt; can be used to download an RSS file and loop over it within your template.</li>
<li>&lt;weblog:variable&gt; allows you to store any text (HTML, template output, whatever) in a named container and then output the results wherever you see fit.</li>
<li>&lt;weblog:if&gt; now understands variables.</li>
<li>&lt;weblog:link&gt; has a new type... rss-discuss.</li></ul>
<p>As a demo, I used all of the above to add "inline" comments to my tech blog... any replies to my posts are displayed along with the entry itself, which will be familiar to those who visit blogs powered by other tools. <a href="http://support.journurl.com/users/admin/index.cfm?mode=article&amp;entry=833">See it in action</a>.</p>
